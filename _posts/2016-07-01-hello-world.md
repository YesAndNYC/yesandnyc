title: Why I'm building a new consulting practice called Yes! and...
subtitle: New beginnings, 18 months in 
---

Hello world!

I've been working as an independent consultant for the past 18 months and today I'm launching a new identity for my work called <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span>

Being self employed is a lot like going on a road trip. It's exciting, sure, but also brings with it a sense of being untethered, of being a long way from home. Always looking to the horizon and the next rest stop, never stopping to build routines. So <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is an acknowledgement that being on the road is now home (metaphorically of course, IRL Brooklyn is still my home although I a coffeeshop nomad).

## Why the name?

The name <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is a nod to the improvisational nature of consulting. Working closely with startups and media companies there is no *normal* and so you have to think on your feet, extrapolate examples and generally figure out the rocketship mid-air. But it's important not to bullshit. So <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is a nod towards fast thinking, but also a reflection of my default positive attitude. No matter how much bu$ine$$ tries, ultimately there's people involved and I try to build empathetic solutions that take the humans into consideration.

## Great! So, what is the work that you do?

Good question! As an independent consultant the kind of work I've done has been wide and varied. For example:

I've worked with media companies like the New York Times and Complex Media on the mechanics of content - SEO strategy, audience development and .

I've also worked with startups - I worked with Olapic as their interim CMO while they sourced a full-time candidate, diving into immediate needs they had and adding some stability in a fast moving environment. I've worked with other startups to guide them on content strategy, how to build editorial content teams that can produce content at scale and 



Hello world!

You're likely reading this because you know me and are curious what I've been up to recently. I've been working in digital marketing for over 10 years now - and self employed as a freelance consultant for the last 18 months. Today I'm launching a new business and identity for my consulting work. It's called <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span>

The name is a riff on the improvisational nature of consulting - one of my strengths is being able to think on my feet without resorting to BS. It requires a careful understanding of the limits of my own knowledge, something I've worked hard on the past few years.

But <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is also about my default positive attitude. Consulting comes with negative connotations and I want to be known for being fun to work with and working on positive business problems for positive businesses.

## On Containers

It's a delicate balance as an independent consultant trying to understand whether I should use my own name or a brand name. Eventually I decided there's a value in building a container that's more than just me. Most of the projects I work on are me working directly with the client but occasionally I end up partnering with trusted folks or bringing in an agency I know can do a good job. We'll see how that evolves - I have no plans to hire people and build an agency right now.

## On Connected Networks & Consulting

The lifeblood of a consultant is their referral network (hi friend! that's people like you!). There's a value in building a website as a marketing site but mostly it's as a digital business card for warm introductions. And I'm fascinated by the value I can bring to clients through *my* referral network - making intros and personal connections has a lot of value, especially for startups who don't have a network of their own. In this regard - expect me to write more about new models of consulting and experiments with group sessions, I have been thinking a lot recently about [small groups and consultancy](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/10/07/small_groups_and_consultancy) by Matt Webb:

>My hunch is this: To answer a business's strategic questions, which will intrinsically involve changing that business, a more permanent solution than a visiting consultant might be to convene a small group, and spend time with it, chatting informally.

More on this soon...

## What does the work look like?

So what kind of work is that I'm good at? And what kinds of clients am I looking for?

My position is that I help companies define and build digital marketing capabilities. Some of my best work is for companies that deal in content - whether that's a media company or just a startup that runs a ton of content marketing.

Some core questions I can help with:

- How do you plan and scale content production without losing editorial voice?
- What kind of marketing engine are you trying to build and what kind of talent do you need (and where do you find them?)
- How do you build a marketing strategy for today's landscape of ever shifting attention?

In more concrete terms - there are typically three ways of engaging with me:

- On-site workshops where we get the interesting people in the room and work through the strategy
- Hands-on work to build the marketing engine, this is typically embedded within your organization
- Recruiting work, helping to understand who you're trying to hire and then finding them

But of course, as an independent consulting practice the ways you can engage are almost limitless and the fun is in finding the right project structure that meets the client's needs directly.

Anyway - here's a nice hello world from <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span>

## Fragile Freedom

It's a fragile freedom but it's the life I'm looking to lead. So the question becomes how to transition a freelance gig into resilience. Time to grow up a little and
