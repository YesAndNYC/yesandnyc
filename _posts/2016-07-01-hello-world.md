title: Why I'm building a new consulting brand called Yes! and...
subtitle: Some thinking on containers, connected networks and consulting 
---

Hello world.

I've been working in digital marketing for over 10 years now - and self employed as a freelance consultant for the last 18 months. Today I'm forming a new business and brand for my consulting work. It's called <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span>

The purpose of forming a new brand and identity for my work is simple - it's the only way to grow my consulting practice beyond myself. My plan is still to stay indie but to gather additional revenue streams and work on bigger projects and <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is the way I want to do that.

## On Containers

As you know - there's a lot of power in naming things. The brain is hard wired to attach labels to things and pattern match off them. So by giving my consulting work a brand that isn't simply "Tom Critchlow doing things" I can pitch for larger pieces of work and work with companies that otherwise may have been put off.

## On Connected Networks

I've passed work to others while I've been working.

## On Consulting

Consulting is improv.
