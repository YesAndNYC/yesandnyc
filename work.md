title: Your Trusted Marketing Advisor
---

As a boutique consulting practice, <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> exists to help companies define and build digital marketing capabilities.

The modern marketing landscape moves fast and breaks things - keeping up is hard for startups who typically lack the expertise in-house to know how to invest in growth. It's also hard for established companies who have defined ways of doing things which typically don't work well in todays environment.

So that's where we come in.

Previous slients include:
- The New York Times
- Hipmunk
- Olapic

We're small, intentionally. Which means we can work on problems that are ill defined. Not everything has to fit inside a box. Often the most pressing challenges are ill-defined and messy. And that's ok. If you're looking to hire an agency and need help we can advise on that too - either by pointing in you the direction of someone we know or getting involved in writing a good brief.

If you want to engage with <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> there's a few ways we typically help out:

## Strategy Workshops

Face to face workshops - where I bring research to the table and we work through your mental models and challenge assumptions can be incredibly valuable. Not only as a way of moving forward but also as a way of aligning and working together to know that there's a good fit.

## Embedded Marketing Strategy

Ongoing work takes many forms - but the kind of work we love the most is embedded within your teams, either on-site or just plugged into your slack channel. Sure, we can make decks and pitch you on the bigger picture but the most useful outputs here are often getting things done. 

## Building Marketing Teams

Helping to scale publishing / editorial / technology / content

## Tom + A distributed team

Yes! and... is the consulting practice of Tom Critchlow, 

## Limited Availability

A personal note from Tom: Hi there, I just had my first child. She's a bundle of sunshine and I'm trying hard to be present and available for her, hopefully for her whole life but certainly for the first few years. What this means is realistically I likely only have room for one or two more clients in 2016. And if I'm a little slower to respond to emails or if there are more typos than you expect please forgive me :)
