title: Hello there!
---

I'm Tom Critchlow, the founder of <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> - something between a consulting practice and a set of distributed consultants. You can follow me on twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow">@tomcritchlow</a>.

I've created this container, brand and website to formalize and provide structure to the loose, improv nature of consulting. It's going to evolve and take on many forms but the core thesis revolves around the following ideas:

 - Distributed & part-time teams are the new normal
 - You can't talk about content marketing without talking about technology
 - There are new models of attention on the web that require fresh thinking
 - Consulting is about getting close to the problem and close to the people

I'm based in Brooklyn, NY and love interesting coffee meetings so get in touch?
