title: Hello there!
---

I'm Tom Critchlow, the founder of <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> - something between an individual consulting practice and a set of distributed consultants. You can follow me on twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow">@tomcritchlow</a>.

I created this container, brand and website to formalize and provide structure to the loose, improv nature of consulting. It's going to evolve and take on many forms but the core thesis revolves around the following ideas:

 - Distributed & part-time teams are the new normal but finding talent is hard
 - You can't talk about content without talking about technology and vice versa
 - There are new models of attention on the web that require fresh thinking

I'm based in Brooklyn, NY and love interesting coffee meetings so get in touch?
